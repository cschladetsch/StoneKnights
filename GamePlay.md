# Stone Knights Gameplay Guide

## Game Overview

Stone Knights is a strategic board game played on an 8x8 grid, where two players compete using knights and stones to control the board and capture their opponent's pieces.

## Components

- **Board**: 8x8 grid
- **Pieces**:
  1. **Knights**: Moving and capturing pieces
  2. **Stones**: Strategic placement blocking and creating capture opportunities

## Objective

The primary goal is to eliminate your opponent's knights while strategically placing stones to control the board.

## Setup

### Initial Placement
- Each player starts with:
  - 8 Knights (placed on the first and last rows)
  - A limited number of stones to place during the game

## Turn Structure

On each turn, a player can do ONE of the following:

1. **Move a Knight**
   - Knights can move to adjacent squares
   - Can capture opponent's knights by moving to their square
   - Cannot move through stones or other pieces

2. **Place a Stone**
   - Place a stone on an empty square
   - Stones cannot move once placed
   - Used to block movement or create capture opportunities

## Capture Mechanics

### Knight Captures
- A knight can capture an opponent's knight by moving to its square
- Captured knights are removed from the board

### Stone Captures
- Stones are captured through a unique chain mechanism
- When a stone is placed, it checks for capture chains in four directions (up, down, left, right)
- A capture chain occurs when:
  1. An opponent's stone is adjacent to the newly placed stone
  2. The chain of opponent's stones is enclosed by stones of the placing player's color
  3. No knights interrupt the chain

### Capture Example
```
Initial state:     After capture:
W B B B W          W   B   W
               becomes
                  W   W   W
```

## Winning the Game

The game is won by:
- Eliminating all of the opponent's knights
- Controlling the majority of the board (in case of a prolonged game)

## Special Rules

- **Stone Limit**: Players have a finite number of stones to place
- **No Suicide Moves**: A move that would immediately lead to the player's own defeat is not allowed
- **Board Control**: Strategic stone placement is key to victory

## Strategy Tips

1. Use stones to create defensive barriers
2. Plan knight movements to create capture opportunities
3. Block critical paths with well-placed stones
4. Balance between offensive knight moves and defensive stone placements

## Advanced Tactics

- Create stone chains to control board sections
- Use stones to funnel opponent's knights into unfavorable positions
- Anticipate and block potential capture chains

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Placing stones without a strategic purpose
- Leaving knights exposed without stone protection
- Focusing solely on capturing and ignoring board control

## Variants and House Rules

Players can modify rules to create unique gameplay experiences:
- Changing the number of initial stones
- Modifying capture mechanics
- Adding special movement rules for knights

## Conclusion

Stone Knights combines elements of strategy, spatial reasoning, and tactical thinking. Success comes from balancing aggressive knight movements with strategic stone placements.
